# My website!

Welcome to my personal space! I created this website to make kind of a portfolio and job experience resume.
And also to try some web features that might seem interesting at the moment.

## Backend

With the same purpose of discovering new techs I created a simple Kotlin server 
that you can check in [Lifesteps API](https://github.com/ochan12/lifesteps-api). 

## Next steps

- [ ] Pictures from my trips
- [ ] Mock server tests
- [ ] Contact information
